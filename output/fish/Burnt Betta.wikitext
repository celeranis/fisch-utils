== Gameplay Notes ==
* Burnt Betta usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Burnt Betta on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Burnt Betta.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Burnt Betta, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Woah, a Burnt Betta!
* How can it survive?
* Crispy!
