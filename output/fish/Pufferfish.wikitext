{{Description|Pufferfish are clumsy swimmers that can fill their elastic stomachs with huge amounts of water & air to blow themselves up to several times their normal size. They do this to evade and scare of predators. On top of their bloating abilities, they also are one of the most poisonous fish in the sea... Also they are the only bony fish which can close their eyes!|Bestiary Entry}}
