'''Midnight Axolotl''' is a {{Rarity|Legendary}} fish found in the [[Desolate Deep]].

== Description ==
{{Description|The Midnight Axolotl is a variant of Axolotl that has adapted to the Desolate Deep. Midnight Axolotls are known for their adorable looks and giant size compared to regular Axolotls. They are most commonly seen at night while other fish sleep. It has been theorized that the glowing gills on the sides of their head have evolved, allowing them to use echolocation to see predators in even the darkest waters. Despite being on the lower end of the food chain, they use their agility and abilities to hide within the Desolate Deep. It is currently unknown how many Midnight Axolotls are residing there|Bestiary Entry}}
