* Lovestorm Eel usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Lovestorm Eel on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Lovestorm Eel.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Lovestorm Eel, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* THE LOVE EEL?
* ELECTRIC LOVE!
* A KISS OF THUNDER!
* SHOCKINGLY SWEET!
