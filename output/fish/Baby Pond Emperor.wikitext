== Gameplay Notes ==
* Baby Pond Emperor usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Baby Pond Emperor on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Baby Pond Emperor.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Baby Pond Emperor, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Woah! a Baby Pond Emperor!
* A Baby Pond Emperor..?
* It's so cute!
