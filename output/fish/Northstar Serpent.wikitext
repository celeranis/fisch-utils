'''Northstar Serpent''' is a {{Rarity|Limited}} fish found in the [[Winter Village]] during the [[Fischmas]] event.

== Description ==
{{Description|The Northstar Serpent is an insanely large and menacing sea serpent species. They have a long and spiny body, with bioluminescent fins throught it. Near their heads, they have six large tentacle-like appendages, which are spun in a screw motion to move at incredible speeds. Attempting to catch the Northstar Serpent will almost always result in catastrophe, those who are capable of hooking and catching such a formidable beast are truly legendary anglers.|Bestiary Entry}}
