== Gameplay Notes ==
* Cinder Carp usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Cinder Carp on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Cinder Carp.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Cinder Carp, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Woah, a Cinder Carp!
* I think it's still smoking?
* It's glowing!
* Everlasting heat!
