== Gameplay Notes ==
* Frozen Leviathan usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Frozen Leviathan on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Frozen Leviathan.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Frozen Leviathan, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* THE FROZEN LEVIATHAN!?!
* ABSOLUTE ZERO!
* FREEZING KRAKEN!?
