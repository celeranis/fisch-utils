== Gameplay Notes ==
* While reeling in an Ancient Megalodon, the fish will ''not'' be visible in the water.
* Ancient Megalodon usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Ancient Megalodon on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Ancient Megalodon.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching an Ancient Megalodon, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* WOAH THE ANCIENT MEG!
