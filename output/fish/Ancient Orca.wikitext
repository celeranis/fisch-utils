== Gameplay Notes ==
* Ancient Orca usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Ancient Orca on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Ancient Orca.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching an Ancient Orca, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Ancient Orca! IMPOSSIBLE!
* The tide bows to its eternal majesty!
