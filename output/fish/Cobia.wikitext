'''Cobia''' is a {{Rarity|Rare}} fish found in the [[Ancient Isle]].

== Description ==
{{Description|The Cobia is a long fish with dark scales throughout the top half of its body, and a lighter underbelly. The torpedo-shaped structure it possesses allows it to dart towards any prey, or swiftly evade larger predators. They feed on smaller fish during the day, and lurk near cover during the night. Their dark body provides nocturnal camoflauge to stay hidden from any nearby prey or predators.|Bestiary Entry}}
