== Gameplay Notes ==
* While reeling in a The Kraken, the fish will ''not'' be visible in the water.
* The Kraken usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a The Kraken on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the The Kraken.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a The Kraken, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* THE KRAKEN ITSELF!
* MASTER OF THE DEPTHS!
* REALITY SHATTERS!
* THE END IS HERE!
