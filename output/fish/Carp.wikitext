'''Carp''' is an {{Rarity|Uncommon}} fish found in [[Moosewood]].

== Description ==
{{Description|Carps are freshwater fish that are known for their whisker-like barbels around their mouth. Carps can adapt to plenty of different environments, as they can thrive in various water conditions. Due to their resilience, they are a common choice for stocking man-made ponds and lakes! They are also pretty cute, in my opinion.|Bestiary Entry}}
