== Gameplay Notes ==
* Toilet Fish usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Toilet Fish on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Toilet Fish.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Toilet Fish, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* sigma
* toilet!!!!!
