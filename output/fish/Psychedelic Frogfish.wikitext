== Gameplay Notes ==
* Psychedelic Frogfish usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Psychedelic Frogfish on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Psychedelic Frogfish.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Psychedelic Frogfish, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* A PSYCHEDELIC FROGFISH?!
* DISCO DIVA OF THE DEEP!
* GROOVY RIBBIT!
