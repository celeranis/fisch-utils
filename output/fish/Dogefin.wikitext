== Gameplay Notes ==
* Dogefin usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Dogefin on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Dogefin.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Dogefin, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* woof woof
* bark bark
