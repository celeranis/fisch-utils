== Gameplay Notes ==
* Storm Skipper usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Storm Skipper on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Storm Skipper.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Storm Skipper, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* A STORM SKIPPER!?!
* ELECTRIC FURY!!
* SHOCKING CATCH!?
