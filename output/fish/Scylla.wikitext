'''Scylla''' is a {{Rarity|Secret}} fish found in the [[Veil of the Forsaken]] of [[Mariana's Veil]].

== Description ==
{{Description|A mythological, multi-headed being said to lurk in the oceanâ€™s deepest abyss. Its serpent-like heads move independently, striking prey with razor-toothed maws, and some believe they regenerate when severed. A myth to most, it is feared as an immortal guardian of the sea, appearing only in the deadliest storms to drag the unwary into the depths.|Bestiary Entry}}

== Gameplay Notes ==
* Scylla usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Scylla on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Scylla.
* The Scylla Progress Speed penalty cannot be reduced with the {{Enchantment|Steady}} [[Enchantment]] or the {{Item|Tempest Rod}} passive ability.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Scylla, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* SCYLLA ITSELF!?!
* IT'S REAL!?!?!?!
* IT'S MASSIVE!!!
* GET THE CAMERA!!!
* THE LEGEND WAS TRUE!!!
