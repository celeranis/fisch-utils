== Gameplay Notes ==
* Scooty Salmon usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Scooty Salmon on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Scooty Salmon.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Scooty Salmon, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Woah, a Scooty Salmon!
* Toasted!
* Could use a rinse.
