== Gameplay Notes ==
* Thornfish usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Thornfish on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Thornfish.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Thornfish, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* A THORNFISH?!
* PRICKLY NIGHTMARE!
* THORN OF DOOM!
