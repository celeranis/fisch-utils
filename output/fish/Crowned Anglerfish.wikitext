** The only exception is when catching a Crowned Anglerfish on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Crowned Anglerfish.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Crowned Anglerfish, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* THE CROWNED ANGLERFISH!?!
* THE ABYSSAL KING!
* SPOOKY KRAKEN!?
