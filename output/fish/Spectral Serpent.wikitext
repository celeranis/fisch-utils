'''Spectral Serpent''' is a {{Rarity|Mythical}} fish found in the [[Desolate Deep]]'s [[Desolate Deep#Brine Pool|Brine Pool]].

== Description ==
{{Description|The Spectral Serpent is an aggressive and ginormous sea serpent species located in the Brine Pool of the Desolate Deep. They possess a translucent exo-membrane covering the inside of their body, as well as 4 bioluminescent eyes. They tend to lurk deeper within the Brine Pool, where they feed on microorganisms. Despite their specific diet, they have many sharp teeth and mandibles along with their hammerhead-shaped skull, which they can use to easily fend off invasive threats. When hooked, they put up an intense fight for even the most experienced anglers.|Bestiary Entry}}
