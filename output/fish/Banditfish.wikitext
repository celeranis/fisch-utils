'''Banditfish''' is a {{Rarity|Rare}} fish found in the [[Desolate Deep]].

== Description ==
{{Description|Banditfish are insanely fast hunters and swimmers, hence their name. They have a single rudder-like fin at the back of their bodies, which they move in a swaying motion to glide throughout the waters. Despite being remarkably good at hunting smaller prey, they are still no match for the greater creatures within the Desolate Deep.|Bestiary Entry}}
