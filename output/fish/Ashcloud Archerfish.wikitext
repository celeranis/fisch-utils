== Gameplay Notes ==
* Ashcloud Archerfish usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Ashcloud Archerfish on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Ashcloud Archerfish.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching an Ashcloud Archerfish, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* HOT HOT HOT!!!
* IT'S HUGE!
* STILL DRIPPING LAVA!
* WHAT IS IT AIMING FOR!?
* THE ASHCLOUD ARCHERFISH?!?
* THE LEGEND IS TRUE!
