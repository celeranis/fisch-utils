== Gameplay Notes ==
* Blistered Eel usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Blistered Eel on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Blistered Eel.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Blistered Eel, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Woah, a Blistered Eel!
* It comes cooked!
* It's well done!
* Could use skin care...
