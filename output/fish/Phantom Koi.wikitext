== Gameplay Notes ==
* Phantom Koi usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Phantom Koi on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Phantom Koi.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Phantom Koi, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* A PHANTOM KOI?!
* GHOSTLY GRACE!
* FIND A BED!
