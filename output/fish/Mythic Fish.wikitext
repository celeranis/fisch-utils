'''Mythic Fish''' is a {{Rarity|Mythical}} fish found in the [[Ocean]].

== Description ==
{{Description|The Mythic Fish is an extremely rare and beautiful fish. They swim gracefully in couples of two near the surface of the ocean water. They seem weak, but they can oddly put up a strong fight when being caught. This is due to the other Mythic Fish attempting to aid it's partner by pulling it off the hook.|Bestiary Entry}}
