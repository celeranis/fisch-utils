'''Stingray''' is a {{Rarity|Rare}} fish found in the [[Ocean]].

== Description ==
{{Description|Graceful and flat, stingrays glide effortlessly through the water, using their wide pectoral fins to move. Their long, whip-like tails end in a sharp stinger, which they can use for defence. Stingrays are bottom dwellers, often found in rocky and sandy seafloors and caves.
