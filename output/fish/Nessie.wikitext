== Gameplay Notes ==
* Nessie usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Nessie on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Nessie.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Nessie, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* WOAH, NESSIE!?!
* MY BACCKK
* I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! NESSIE!
* I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS REAL!!
