'''Eel''' is an {{Rarity|Unusual}} fish found in [[Moosewood]].

== Description ==
{{Description|Eels are a long snake-like, ray-finned fish that is primarily nocturnal. They have a keen sense of smell and can be harmful to humans due to their strong jaws with sharp teeth. Some eels also contain toxins that will destroy red blood cells. Eels move in an interesting way due to them not having pelvic or pectoral fins. To swim, eels generate waves that travel the length of their body, animating them similar to snakes.|Bestiary Entry}}
