'''Slate Tuna''' is a {{Rarity|Common}} fish found in the [[Desolate Deep]].

== Description ==
{{Description|With their Stone Exocranium on the front of their body, the invasive Slate Tuna is able to hunt and kill pray at alarmingly high rates. However, this stone noggin of theirs also ends up in slower swim speeds for this predator, resulting with this fish being lower down on the food chain in this deep chasm.|Bestiary Entry}}
