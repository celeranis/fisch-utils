== Gameplay Notes ==
* Mustard usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Mustard on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Mustard.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Mustard, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Mustard!
* I caught Mustard!
* Woah! Mustard!
* MUSTARD!!!
* Mustard?!
* Augh...
