== Gameplay Notes ==
* Molten Minnow usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Molten Minnow on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Molten Minnow.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Molten Minnow, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Woah, a Molten Minnow!
* Searing hot!
* My hands!
