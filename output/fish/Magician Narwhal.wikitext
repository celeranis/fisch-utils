== Gameplay Notes ==
* Magician Narwhal usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Magician Narwhal on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Magician Narwhal.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Magician Narwhal, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* A MAGICIAN NARWHAL!?!?!
* I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
* IT WAS REAL?!
* PURE MAGIC!
* THAT WAS MY CARD!
* HOW DID IT DO THAT?!?
* THAT'S A NICE HAT!
