== Gameplay Notes ==
* Black Grouper usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Black Grouper on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Black Grouper.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Black Grouper, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* A BLACK GROUPER!
* SHADOW OF THE SEA!
* MYSTERIOUS GIANT!
