== Gameplay Notes ==
* While reeling in a Moby, the fish will ''not'' be visible in the water.
* Moby usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Moby on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Moby.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Moby, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Moby?! IMPOSSIBLE!
* BIG FOREHEAD!
* UNMATCHED STRENGTH!
* IT DIDN'T DESTROY MY BOAT!
