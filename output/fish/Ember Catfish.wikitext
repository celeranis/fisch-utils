== Gameplay Notes ==
* Ember Catfish usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Ember Catfish on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Ember Catfish.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching an Ember Catfish, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Woah, an Ember Catfish!
* Why isn't it purring?
* Smoldering!
* A little fire hazard!
