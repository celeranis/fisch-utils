== Gameplay Notes ==
* While reeling in an Ancient Kraken, the fish will ''not'' be visible in the water.
* Ancient Kraken usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Ancient Kraken on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Ancient Kraken.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching an Ancient Kraken, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* THE ANCIENT ONE!
* PRIMAL DARKNESS!
* BEYOND REALITY!
* THE END COMES!
