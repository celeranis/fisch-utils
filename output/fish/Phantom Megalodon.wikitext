Though extinct for millions of years, this ghostly apex predator dominates the Ancient Isle and will challenge any angler brave enough to hook it.|Bestiary Entry}}

== Obtainment ==
{{Description|The Phantom Meg only emerges during the eclipse & twilight hours of the celestial cycle, when the sun and moon align every seven days.|Bestiary Hint}}

== Gameplay Notes ==
* While reeling in a Phantom Megalodon, the fish will ''not'' be visible in the water.
* Phantom Megalodon usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Phantom Megalodon on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Phantom Megalodon.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Phantom Megalodon, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* WOAH THE PHANTOM MEG!
