'''Umbral Shark''' is a {{Rarity|Legendary}} fish found in the [[Keepers Altar]].

== Description ==
{{Description|Umbral Sharks are a nocturnal bottom feeder, spending most of their time on the floor or in small crevices. They are gentle and slow-moving until provoked. Once angered, they can be extremely strong swimmers and often will break fishing lines. They are extremely rare, as they don't often come high enough in the water for anyone to see.|Bestiary Entry}}
