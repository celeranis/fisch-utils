== Gameplay Notes ==
* Lava Lamprey usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Lava Lamprey on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Lava Lamprey.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Lava Lamprey, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* Woah. a Lava Lamprey!
* Pretty!
* Straight out of the '60s!
* Trippy!
