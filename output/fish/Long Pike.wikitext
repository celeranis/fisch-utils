== Gameplay Notes ==
* Long Pike usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Long Pike on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Long Pike.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Long Pike, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* A Long Pike!
* I caught a Long Pike!
* Woah! a Long Pike!
* LONG PIKE!!!
* A Long Pike?!
* That's a long Pike!
