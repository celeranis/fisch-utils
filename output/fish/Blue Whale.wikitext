== Gameplay Notes ==
* Blue Whale usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Blue Whale on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Blue Whale.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Blue Whale, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* BLUE WHALE!
* PRETTY BLUE!
* I'll need a line replacement!
* Extra large!
