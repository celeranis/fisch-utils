== Gameplay Notes ==
* Abyssborn Monstrosity usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Abyssborn Monstrosity on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Abyssborn Monstrosity.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching an Abyssborn Monstrosity, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* AN ABYSSBORN MONSTROSITY?!
* BORN OF THE VOID!
* MONSTER OF ETERNITY!
