== Gameplay Notes ==
* Bloop Fish usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Bloop Fish on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Bloop Fish.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Bloop Fish, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* A BLOOP FISH!?!?!
* I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
* IT WAS REAL?!
* BLOOP!
* MASSIVE!
