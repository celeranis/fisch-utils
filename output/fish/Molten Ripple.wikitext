== Gameplay Notes ==
* Molten Ripple usually cannot be caught with passive effects, such as the one provided by the [[Rod Of The Depths]] and [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]].
** The only exception is when catching a Molten Ripple on the Megalodon Passive reel of the [[Rod Of The Forgotten Fang]], the Megalodon will instead dupe the Molten Ripple.

== Catch Quips ==
When catching a Molten Ripple, the player has a chance to make one of the following exclamations:
* A MOLTEN RIPPLE?!
* SMILING FLAME!
* CUTE INFERNO!
